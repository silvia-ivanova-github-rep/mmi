	- explore the role of credibility in the selection of search engine content (SERPs)

		      * common searchqueries lead to more popular content

247 particiapants -> completed 2 information research tasks on a result pages of a search engine

RESULTS 
Research results have shown that:
	- users trust the search engines’ranking uncritically (search results is mainly influenced by the ranking on the results page) and 
	- mostly select top-ranked results
	- 3 credibility indicators - the reputation of the source, the neutrality of the statement and social recommendations
	- only a high reputation of the source ensures an increased selection probability
	- most web users rely on search engines to search and find their desired information
	- the results of our study confirm the significance of the ranking.

drastically increased content on internet, so the user need to actively select the content
